Google Kubernetes Engine ([GKE](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine))
is a managed container service to run and scale Kubernetes applications in the cloud or on-premises.

Camunda 8 Self-Managed can be deployed on any Kubernetes cluster using [Helm charts](/self-managed/setup/install.md), like GKE.

Cloud provider-specific information is available on our [Kubernetes one-stop page](/self-managed/reference-architecture/kubernetes.md).
